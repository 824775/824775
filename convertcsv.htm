<td>Its unbelievable. You would think a company that acts like their so &quot;passionate&quot; about mmorpgs that they would put all their time and effort into working on the mmo and be glad to have people giving them constructive criticism to not fall into the same mistakes as other MMOs have in the past. Yet they block out any negative feedback and pull out a br that no one asked for. It&#39;s quite sad. I&#39;m starting to lose hope on this tittle. At this point I can only hope to be presently surprised.</td>

<td>Anyone surprised by the greed has been awfully ignorant.<br/>They lock character customization and chat features behind pay walls and added a cash shop with monthly exclusive stuff (which severely lack descriptions) a full 2 years before the game is even supposed to launch, assuming no delays.<br/>Never seen anything that even compares to that level of greed in gaming.</td>

<td>I was very hopeful for ashes when the kickstarter hit, so much so that I pledged over 100 dollars despite promising myself I would never do that again. After that though there was the webpage kickstarter for &quot;those who didn&#39;t have access to kickstarter allowed payment methods&quot;. I was okay for that for the most part but it did start me feeling a bit uneasy. Since then though there are new cosmetics being sold constantly and we aren&#39;t really getting any real information and the stock visuals coming with the engine are still there. I&#39;ve lost most of my hope for ashes to be a decent MMO, if it even comes out in anything like the hopes I&#39;ve had. Hope I am wrong.</td>

All that said, I knew about the game and was really looking forward to it.  To hear that they&#39;ve ended up coming out with a monetized BR game, rather than the MMORPG that they&#39;ve promised, completely disheartens me with the entire project.  <br/><br/>I&#39;ve been a hardcore fan of MMORPGs since the days of Star Wars Galaxies and Matrix Online.  I&#39;ve seen and played just about every other MMORPG that&#39;s come out since then and while I want Ashes of Creation to be the next great MMO I&#39;ve been waiting a very, very long time for.  I&#39;ve seen enough botches games to know that Ashes is probably not going to be that next great game...  And if is, it&#39;s going to take a lot longer than a few months based on the footage the developers have shown.</td>

<td>I made till the end, Ziz :P I&#39;m not gonna raise a black or white flag for Ashes here, I&#39;m in the middle ground... Let me explain, I agree with you on a lot of stuff that you said. I invested a LOT of money on this game for the Kickstarter and I&#39;ve been hyped for the game. Some people are still insanely hyped for this game and I don&#39;t understand why, &#39;cause I&#39;m not due to lack of progress shown. Instead, I&#39;m hopeful. I&#39;m hopeful, like you, that the game will succeed and deliver on everything! But honestly, I&#39;d be happy with 50% of what they promised because let&#39;s be honest, he promised EVERYTHING in this MMO... Which is completely insane. With that said, I&#39;m not at the point where I&#39;m angry yet and I understand why you are! You make a compelling argument and even though he justifies his reasoning for removing you for the program, he should&#39;ve asked to chat with you to discuss the matter instead of black balling you, this is ridiculous. Steven is cocky, over-promises, and doesn&#39;t know how to talk to the community. But still, I am hopeful that the game (the MMO, not some wonky BR) will come out and it&#39;ll be our new MMO home, though I am also expecting a delay... 2 years? Maybe not, but 6-12 months? Maybe!<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, that was a long ass message, but I&#39;m with you on a LOT of a stuff that you&#39;ve said and I understand the frustration behind the game, oh boy do I understand it and agree with it. But I&#39;ll refrain from ranting about it for now and honestly? I&#39;ll wait till Alpha 1 of the MMORPG to see if they have made actual progress on the MMO. What we need (you and I!) is a gosh darn MMO TESTING SESSION so we can seeeeeeeee something... not hear that everything is PERFECT from Steven&#39;s mouth... I&#39;m tired of that, so tired. I want to test it, when? Now please? But I&#39;ll be happy to wait a few months to test it, and I hope I see you there Ziz and we can either be happy with the testing together, or bash it together!</td>

<td>Thank you for this video. I&#39;ve been skeptical for some time on what is actually happening since the Kickstarter. I just kept seeing monthly cosmetics and the &quot;Alpha 0&quot; that I never got invited to even though the Kickstarter package said &quot;first alpha&quot;, to that I thought something shady was going on with the cheeky wording. I&#39;ve kept tabs on the game&#39;s progress through YouTube and Reddit, till the company took over the Reddit... Not to mention all of the negative history associated that was talked about there beforehand. Apocalypse came out of nowhere to me, not being a Discord follower, when I got the invite I was disappointed to see it was a fantasy Fortnite-ish clone... The only redeeming value I&#39;ve found is that they do have some substance and functionality of design going, but the PR and communication is the worst I&#39;ve seen for an MMO trying to be a AAA title. I&#39;m not very hopeful at this point, this won&#39;t be a company I can rally behind like Blizzard pre-Activision, but I&#39;m hoping for a decent game at some point. In Steven&#39;s own words, Ashes of Creation is &quot;frankly quite disappointing&quot;.</td>

I know only one sandbox mmorpg that is a success and has been for a decade and it&#39;s Eve Online. First of who is Steven? What did he play? What was his name? He should be known around communities and such and I have been playing MMORPG&#39;s since 12 years old never heard of the guy ever. Then this BR BS dropped down supposedly to test things out yet they keep adding to br not giving mmorpg news this game is going to flop for sure.</td>

<td>This is exactly what people don&#39;t understand. An opinion is a judgment, viewpoint, or statement that is not conclusive. A fact is a thing that is known to be consistent with objective reality and can be proven to be true with evidence. Right now this guy is saying he didn&#39;t do anything wrong but in reality he did say things that people took for facts because he did not present those things as opinions but he presented them as facts.  People should just sit down and go do little research instead of taking everything from face value in this video. He even said that he defended the game a lot and was very &quot;White knight&quot; but that doesn&#39;t nullify his &quot;facts&quot; that he said in his video.</td>

<td>Honestly, I&#39;m done with AoC. It&#39;s the game that lighten up the hope of MMORPG in me and yet it is also the one that destroys it to the point that I&#39;m back to not caring about MMORPGs anymore. I&#39;m still subscribed to AoC&#39;s content creators but I don&#39;t even look at their thumbnails anymore. They ruined their credibility with their terrible &quot;new website&quot; launch which looked like an incomplete school project done by a student who only wants the grade and not being passionate about it at all. The new website was delayed for months and yet after all those months, it is still incomplete with basic features missing.<br/><br/>That&#39;s just the website, we&#39;re not even talking about the game yet. There&#39;s nothing be talked about, actually. I don&#39;t think they have the people capable to develop this game. Look at the placeholder UI. Those aren&#39;t placeholders, I&#39;m sure. I am also sure that that&#39;s the best their designers can do. Placeholder UI shouldn&#39;t look that bad. The launcher all to the way into the Apocalypse game looks terrible, like something from 2003. I&#39;d rather have an empty UI with only black boxes than those things. They took a lot of time on that one I&#39;m sure. Either the designers are bad or Steven have a terrible taste. We all know that Steven is the Benevolent Dictator in this game&#39;s development. If anything is bad, it must be him lol. The rest of the team is stacked, there&#39;s no reason to not doubt that it is Steven that&#39;s being the heavy sandbag.<br/><br/>There&#39;s only one thing that the team got it right. The level and environmental design is absolutely astonishing. The best I have seen in any MMO and that is also why I want this game to succeed. I can only talk about these things because we don&#39;t see anything about the game yet. It&#39;s almost as if what you said is true, it doesn&#39;t exist. The combat they show in the &quot;gameplay demo&quot; is what we&#39;ve seen in the Apocalypse and yes, it&#39;s horrible.<br/><br/>I guess that&#39;s it. I won&#39;t read or watch anything about AoC anymore and wait until 2020. If the game is released, I will hear of it I&#39;m sure. If not, I can safely assume that the game is dead and I can keep on laughing to Kickstarter backers because they always fall for these crowdfunding memes LUL.</td>

Then after that they came out with PAX East packs, then pre-order packs, and then several other packs after that with some having better rewards than the Kickstarter packs. When they said &quot;NO P2W&quot; it got me hooked, but in my opinion... the game looks like it is going to be cosmetic store based in where all in-game armour looks like trash and only store outfits look good and cost $15, that way they keep their promise of no pay to win but still reap the rewards of microtransactions.

IMO it just comes off as following the path to making $ which as a business move is VERY smart. People seem to like it.<br/><br/>However, as someone who was looking forward to the actual progression of the MMO, this made me feel like they were prioritizing some cash grab. I haven&#39;t played the BR and don&#39;t plan on it. I&#39;ve yet to see much happening with the MMO and maybe I was too quick to judge but I&#39;ve seen shit like this before. I really do hope this game turns out to be amazing but I don&#39;t support the focus of the BR. Maybe they are making a ton of progress on the MMO behind the scenes but from my view, I don&#39;t see it.<br/><br/>I do agree with your points so far and I&#39;m neutral about them removing you. I think you should be able to be honest, definitely. For them though, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d want to have that on an official podcast simply because things can be taken out of context. The few words you say about them not working on an MMO even if it&#39;s backed by a speech explaining what you mean.. the internet will jump the gun and scream ZIZ SAID THEY ARENT WORKING ON IT SO THEY ARENT WORKING ON IT.. just how people are. If the podcast wasn&#39;t &#39;official&#39; though, and something you and your friends decided to do, I&#39;m leaning more towards it being wrong of them stripping the role from you. Steven is the father of this though and bosses can do what they see fit so \O/<br/><br/>I love the honesty. Gonna continue to listen, keep up the good content.</td>

<td>so much salt...  There is nothing positive about your video.  I get that there can be concerns about this game but this just sounds like just pure negativity.  Give them a break, they are trying so many new things with a limited budget compared to AAA publishers.  I don&#39;t believe the before 2020 date.  I expect a full year pushback and i&#39;m not crying about it, the result will be amazing.</td>

As you said I hope I am wrong and we get the best MMO ever. I hate BR games which is why I wanted an MMO and have not tested anything because it is not my cup of tea. This is beginning to feel like Warhammer 40k Eternal Crusade... If you do not know about that was suppose to be like planetside and they turned it into a lobby based shooter.</td>

<td>They may still be doing AoC but the Battle Royal is worrisome. I bought in at the beginning and I hope it works but I am doubtful now. They keep saying over and over again the Battle Royal gives them great information. To me it seems like they are testing a Battle Royal when they should be creating the game. Even the website no longer works and they are making it more difficult to discuss and communicate regarding AoC. I don&#39;t even bother to log into the BR anymore. If that is a reflection of the game I am even more worried. They keep saying they are getting tons of good information but now they seem to want to make it a game. Would have been better to let us test a dungeon with some mobs or a starting zone. I cannot even count the number of MMOs I have preordered just to have the game fail. I am reminded too much of EQnext and LANDMARK. You all remember that? The promises and lies all the way to the end. You did lose me around 30.00 when you went off the rails. It is PrePreAlfa.</td>

<td>I logged into my Ashes account today, cause I haven&#39;t in a very long time. And the sites changed since my last login, so who knows when that was. But when I check my account, I see nothing about my kickstarter backing. And I didn&#39;t spend as much as you, I just did the Pioneer package allowing me access to beta, but I did pledge. I&#39;m starting to feel like I got scammed. I mean I have seen no updates or email notifications about what&#39;s happening in the game. I had to find out about Apocalypse via random youtubers covering it. And a few times when I have said &quot;Gee... I don&#39;t see much happening with this game, I&#39;m concerned where it&#39;s going&quot; I have gotten yelled at because I&#39;m obviously not looking in the right places for updates and info. Now this means little, but the kickstarter says the delivery for BETA should be Dec 2018. I&#39;m realistic when it comes to games and game development. To make a good game takes time. But the current state of ashes makes me feel like its still in pre-alpha without any of the core features we were promised. I really hope this game turns into something amazing. But as it stands, it&#39;s so far off my radar now I lack any real enthusiasm for it.</td>

<td>Interesting video with a rather impassioned response to an unfortunate symptom of a rather conflicted genre. All of your concerns raised are reminiscent of the same conversations held for each MMO since the rise of World of Warcraft. Thankfully we have passed the &quot;WoW Killer&quot; mentality prevalent during the earlier years, however the same issues and conversations are being raised over each upcoming MMO. I find it rather depressing that the gaming industry has entered an era of confusion regarding online gaming. This mentality sadly is a symptom of the modern gamer being at a loss as to what they really want. Many of us, myself included have entered a stage where we all recognise the stagnation of the industry, this may be a symptom of growing older or perhaps due to the lack of true innovation within the genre.Regardless of where Ashes of Creation heads, it is evident from the outsider that the game is a classic example of passion over reality. Their time would be best spent creating a foundation, a minimum viable product and then add additional features as they polish the base principles.</td>

<td>Yeah, the purpose of the Content Creator program is to reassure those who might be misinformed that the devs aren&#39;t making progress on the MMORPG and to explain how the features of the BR translate to the development of the MMORPG. So, if you make vids stating that the BR isn&#39;t contributing to the development of the MMORPG, then you should expect to be kicked from that program.<br/>Same if you make comments like &quot;They don&#39;t even have a forums anymore, rather than, &quot;Their forums are down right now.&quot;<br/>I think they communicated very clearly to the Content Creators that Jan 18th is the Open Beta. and they even specifically sent an e-mail discussing the specific talking points abut which they wanted Content Creators to inform their followers. Especially that Apoc is Open Beta.<br/><br/>But, it&#39;s really not that big of a deal. You haven&#39;t been banned from the game.

<td>See and this is why I don&#39;t buy into crowd funded games and such prior to launch or at the very least an official &#39;early access&#39; release where most of the systems are already in the game. I get why you&#39;re upset, frustrated and even a big scared. I know I would be all of those things if I had paid $400 toward a game in development. I think I did it one time back in the early 2000&#39;s with a game called Dark &amp; Light. It promised the world and asked us to pay $60 to join their &quot;beta&quot; which turned out to be a pre-alpha kind of experience. In the end the game flopped and I never saw a cent of that money again. Oddly enough someone is trying to bring that game back because I just recently saw it on Steam and all my nightmares came flashing back to me.<br/><br/>As a gamer I understand your &quot;passionate&quot; response. However as a games journalist there is an expected level of diplomacy that comes with interacting with creators. Remember they&#39;re game developers. They&#39;re not used to press releases or dealing with hyped up fans. I&#39;m not trying to create excuses for them, they should be more transparent to begin with since they are asking for backers to give them money but on the other hand they may have a plan in place and just are not ready to share it. I&#39;m watching this game with cautious optimism but frankly when ever someone says the words &quot;Battle Royale&quot; now I just assume the developer is building it to cash in on the current fad in gaming.</td>

<td>While i dont necessarily agree with your points..I think people overhyped this game from the beginning. You pledge 500USD to a company who had to start out trough kickstarter and hope it ends up being better than the big names out there. In that regard alone theres only dissapointment to be found. You said some nasty stuff, but getting  kicked for that also says quite a bit about how the devs handle negative feedback..</td>

<td>Watched to the end. Ashes of Landmark amirite? I bought into the founder&#39;s pack for EQN and spent a few hundred hours in EQN Landmark trying things out, trying to break things, and I smiled at the bugs most of the time and screw burled wood. When they announced that EQN was cancelled I was just... betrayed. I understood the reasons, but it just sucked.<br/>Honestly, I took Ashes of Creation off of my list of MMOs to look forward to back when they showed their first teasers. It just looked like another ArcheAge, which I didn&#39;t enjoy due to bland tab target combat and excessive need for cash shop merch. AoC came back on my radar during the last couple of weeks when I saw that they were getting rid of the old tab-target style of combat and testing action combat via BR. As you pointed out though, I haven&#39;t seen any hint of  progress on the core systems. After viewing the combat, all I&#39;ve seen are some overly flashy skill graphics that clutter the screen. I kept seeing massive explosions from meteors falling on little... spider things? In games, large flashy graphics are usually only used for large impactful abilities. Abilities that make you go &quot;This is your end!&quot; When every skill is just coating your screenspace in lights and explosions while having little noticeable effect on the flow of combat, it just feels half-baked. <br/>I also agree that the quest system shown was barebones. For a game that&#39;s supposed to come out this year, it looks quite far behind. A large portion of their MMO Development update looked to just be them running around a mostly empty map following a path and killing enemies in hand placed encounters, like you said.<br/>I might poke at the game again if I see progress, but I&#39;ll probably turn my attention towards one of the other titles that are in development this year.</td>

<td>This will continue to be a trend. I don&#39;t understand how people honestly ever believed this project was going to release in working order, in one piece, cohesive and as originally advertised or, at least, anywhere close to. This, in it&#39;s inception, is the most massively ambitious, massively multiplayer game ever &quot;offered.&quot; The mindbogglingly complex, interactive nature of just the core systems, never mind the endless amount of frameworks, features, design concepts, design philosophy, systems, sub-systems etc. piled on top are, at this point, unproven/untested. And this reaches to a core problem that Intrepid will be continuously faced with, aside from how they deal with criticism; they are unproven. They have marketing. Great marketing. Really captured people&#39;s attention, hearts, imagination. Many grand promises. But, no working models or proofs of concepts. Not any that the people who would be buying(or bought into) the game or those who would fill the world, have seen anyways. Anyone can promise the stars....but where&#39;s some evidence of delivery? When&#39;s the last time someone handed you a star. Thankfully, Visionary Realms doesn&#39;t seem to be affected by the same bullshit...fingers crossed</td>

<td>If you still have hope and still think it’s a good game then why put bs bashing clickbait like “wtf happened to ashes”. I think it’s good they’re severing ties with content creators. Even the GOOD POSITIVE NON CLICKBAIT creators are toxic for the mmo community. I think content creation is one of the main reasons for the failing mmo genre. Before the games are even out to the public now, you content creators plaster EVERY little detail about the game, and by the time it releases, there’s no mystery or intrigue, and nobody has to discover things on their own. The reason vanilla wow/eq/rs and all those were great was because there was no info on release really. You had to discover on your own. Now there are in depth raid strats a month before release. You should all go away. I will agree they’re severing ties for the WRONG  reason and being tools about it. But it’s probably a good thing in the end. Might make things more exciting when it finally does release</td>

You did not cheat, you did not tell people how to cheat or use a glitch. I try to understand a company is paying players to advertise their product. However paid advertisement is different from paying players to evaluate the game and tell people their honest opinion.<br/><br/>So it depends on your agreement with them. You did not talk about that. But it is important. I would very much like to understand what you guys agreed too, (if you are allowed to talk about that). <br/><br/>So my question is this: Are content creators paid to advertise or give their honest opinion?<br/><br/>Thanks</td>

Your entire rant is based out of your personal opinions and emotions rather than facts, and that is why you were kicked. The entire time I&#39;m watching this video all I hear is &quot;I feel they are doing this...&quot; or &quot;My hopes are that...&quot; feelings are not facts, no matter how passionate you are about a game. To make the situation worse, your first reaction is to go on the attack rather than taking a step back and looking at all the details. Around the 10 minute mark you start attacking Steven verbally and claiming he isn&#39;t a man and claims no responsibility for a &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;. Intrepid Studios has claimed, from the start, that they want to be as transparent as possible with the community. This doesn&#39;t mean, however, that it is their responsibility to come to you and give all the information that you desire. They are a  Content Company, not Mrs. Hope&#39;s Divinity Palor. They can&#39;t read your future nor tell you your darkest thoughts. This means that if you have questions or concerns, you need to speak with them and see what they have to say about it. The WRONG way is to do a podcast and blast them without allowing them to discuss the issues with you. This is why you were kicked out.  Your concerns are legitimate about the game, but you&#39;ve fallen into the trap of &quot;I&#39;m playing this game in its early stages, unpolished and only the rawest of animations, so this must be what it will look and feel like in two years.&quot; and thus have removed all due diligence and replaced it with entitled expectations. This comment isn&#39;t about defending Steven and his team, but it is about taking personal responsibility. If you&#39;re unable to remain objective during game testing and follow the proper courses of action when dealing with companies and their new games, then perhaps you should stick to other areas of content creation. Simply put, you&#39;ve been kicked out for the right reasons and should take this as a lesson and not some kind of political stab toward your hobby.</td>

I will probably still give AoC a chance mainly thanks to the seasons however I will not have any high hopes for it seeing how it comes off as a really large cash grab. Definitely hope that I am wrong though.</td>

Priorities that are focused on getting the game out faster and making the game better. I don&#39;t think its fair to insinuate or call anyone a liar yet.

<td>As a game dev myself, this is a tricky situation. Here you have a great idea that you want ti create, BUT there is so much money being tossed around for BR. Most companies are trying to MAKE money. It&#39;s a company before any game association.  So if they can add BR and get some money rolling aka star citizen, they can hire more employees and create the MMO easier. Trying to create AAA MMO with hundreds if millions is literally impossible to begin with. Now being constantly negative, over and over for a dev can get tiresome. Better for both parties to move forward, it&#39;s ok to be critical but no one wants to hear all the negative when your giving them access.</td>

<td>I watched the entire video, because I too am heavily invested in this game even if its more emotionally for me than financially lol. I have to say I first subscribed to you when I saw the &quot;big problems&quot; video because I liked the way you analyzed things. You take a very realistic and objective approach to criticizing the game, which is extremely important, because Steven is a dreamer and sometimes it feels like he has his head in the clouds. I feel like he needs people to slap him back to reality because if he doesnt take some realism into consideration then this game is not going to be a success. I get that hyping up the game brings kickstarters and more funds to developing the game, but at the same time if intrepid doesn&#39;t deliver on that hype even just a little, then the game is just dead on arrival. Ive seen it before in games like No Man&#39;s Sky and The division. Even if you fix your mistakes and make the game great in a later update, a lot of the damage is already done and can&#39;t be recovered from if you put a bad taste in peoples mouths right from the start. They want to do so much with this game in so little time, and i feel like its just not a very realistic goal. That being said this video comes across as though you took their decision to remove you from their cc program personally, and you are being a little hyper critical of the game because of that. I say that because you nitpick at little things like minor bugs and shitty animations and mobs. All of those things are obvious that they are going to look like shit right now lol. But thumbs up on the video, and thank you for representing the community with some realistic criticism. It&#39;s exactly what the development of this game needs, and I know that the people who express their concerns about the game the most are the ones who care about its success the most. If Steven doesn&#39;t come to realize that as well then it may mean bad things for the game. Much respect to you and your opinions. Hope you keep it up with great ashes content. Also I completely agree that they should have SOMETHING more to show us than what they have, especially considering all of their promises to be transparent during development of this game and all of the funding they have received from the community.</td>

<td>I made it! <br/><br/>I don&#39;t follow the game as closely as some but, this video mirrors a lot of my thoughts. I personally hate BR games. I don&#39;t generally go in for strict forced pvp games, not my bad of fun. I understand its popular and people like them, and for me that&#39;s a good thing. It keeps those kinds of players out of the games I like to play :) AoC always had some red flags for me. And until its released, and playable to the public, I will always be cautious. I think there&#39;s one point you made in this video that should be on everyone&#39;s mind. Has nothing to do with you getting kicked from CC, or why, or was it right. Has nothing to do with the test being a BR, well kinda maybe. I Think the MOST important thing that I really hope this video will bring to the forefront of peoples minds and fan boi reactions is Where Is the proof? Where is the proof of concept on all these systems itsziz talks about in this video? He is 100% right saying that they&#39;ve shown just pictures of things. Nodes don&#39;t actually change in game, wheres the caravan system, the classes, the running a town yada yada yada. It may all be just around the corner, part of different alphas and betas? It worries me as a fan of MMO&#39;s how defensive people are to this company and game potential. The fact remains that the game is supposed to launch very soon, and almost nothing of the mmo and how it feels has actually been shown to us. <br/><br/>Will the game eventually be made, yes. But it&#39;ll either get delayed, or launch as a pile of crap that only the content creators still around will get to play lol. <br/><br/>I havn&#39;t watch the podcast video to see his rant that got him booted but, I also have similar concerns.</td>

It&#39;s important that we the gamers make our voices heard and let all the cashgrabbing &quot;developers&quot; know that it&#39;s enough now. We want developers who are passionate about making great games that they themselves would love to play, and that they can&#39;t wait to share with their future customers. But 2018 has more and more shown that developers aren&#39;t creating games for gamers anymore - they are doing it to grab all the cash they can. So @itsZiz, I appreciate this video a lot! Stay strong and hopefully developers will wake up - sooner than later!</td>

<td>I also really hope that this game does well for the same reason; I want to play a good mmo too. The BR open beta launch then removal/delay was disappointing and all of its micro-transactions don&#39;t help. A really good point was made here and in the podcast about intrepid using their community as a sort of free QA team. That&#39;s never a good idea especially when part of the community actually paid to access some of the early testing. It should definitely be the other way around. Making people pay ludicrous amounts to play a broken game is terrible. A much better idea is to have all access to early gameplay be free and random and maybe give content creators some priority. Doing that while also having a dedicated, paid QA team to test some of the more tedious issues is a must.<br/><br/>The big idea of what some call &quot;nitpicking&quot; is that with the release of the game slated to be in late 2019 the simple lack of many if not most major systems is concerning. Ziz doesn&#39;t want to see this game fail but bad press is important so that the developers have a chance to address issues in the game before its launch. My biggest fear is that they either rush the development to reach their goals and we end up with something like Atlas, or they run out of money because they&#39;ve extended too much and outside investors tear the game apart.<br/><br/>I understand if they don&#39;t want to show certain parts of the game because they aren&#39;t done, but what was shown in their early mmo gameplay footage does not inspire confidence in a game that is suppose to be released this year. Just think about what you want this game to be and what Steven and Intrepid says it will be, then look at the development timeline of other mmos, and finally the last ashes of creation gameplay video. It doesn&#39;t look like a game that is ahead of schedule.<br/><br/>Sorry for such an essay<br/>tldr: APoC really strange, Free QA team?, Development timeline either way too ambitious or sneak peaks misleading.</td>

<td>Made it through the whole video. You made some good points throughout the video and I, like you, am a Kickstarter backer that is not a fan of the BR and its distractions. That being said, you probably should have waited a bit to calm down before you made this video. As others have pointed out it quickly devolves into just personal attacks and rants to the point that much of your arguments are lost in all of the petty comments and bitterness. You got in some jabs at Intrepid and AoC but at the same time, your reputation and overall appeal also took some shots as a result of this video. I wish you had kept it more professional. Just my 2 cents.</td>

Like seriously, why haven&#39;t they shown any gameplay of the features they promise? All they show is characters walking through cities. Where is the &quot;BDO-level character creation system&quot;, where is footage of the class system? Why haven&#39;t they shown us crafting? They said they were going to show a raid boss in one of their streams but instead we got a video of them killing some mushrooms. They said they needed to add cash shop in apoc so they could get money to ensure they have quality servers. What happens? People sit in queue for half an hour, EU players can&#39;t even get in at all and now they have to shut it down for the public. I just want to see something that gives me hope for the game again.

<td>@itsZiz I apologize for this late comment, but you can&#39;t make content that is mostly personal, especially negative content and expect to see positive feedback or be satisfied. Even if you are correct about Intrepid significantly delaying the game, I personally would not mind.<br/><br/>As long as the game is what Steven had foreseen it as: a world where people can create experiences with one another, this would be 100% acceptable. I don&#39;t think you have the same desire to see how this AoC will succeed as the rest of Intrepid Studios does.<br/><br/>You are only concerned about the end project, and that view alone won&#39;t cut it. Unlike you, there are people in this community including Steven who have a desire and a flame burning in their eyes for this game. Intrepid Studios and the people in the community are excited and will be excited about every little aspect going into this game from the launch of the BR to the launch of the MMO itself.<br/><br/>Why??<br/><br/>Because each detail and test has a purpose to make AoC succeed whether it&#39;s a failed or successful test. The thrill of quests and a great combat system with nodes, a government, and economy is wonderful! There will be SO much diversity. But I believe that is only half if not less to take from the MMO experience. The REAL experience to take from AoC is to feel welcome into a new home and to create experiences with other players.<br/><br/>To carefully test and implement every detail in every aspect of the game will result in this experience. Intrepid wants to make AoC feel like reality where the players have a home to go to and want to go home. That is what will create the best MMORPG of this generation. I believe in them and you should learn to as well.</td>

I have my realistic view on these things, I see a lot of issues with the game, mainly the mechanics which sound amazing but imo will never work unless the promised functionality gets reduced dramatically leaving the players with a way smaller impact on the world. <br/>A project of the promised scale would take 10 years of development and futher two years of open alpha/beta testing and the budget would have to be huuuuge. <br/>I expect ashes to start as a classic mmorpg with a few nice features, and to be honest, as long as it&#39;s all polished I&#39;m fine with that. I&#39;m sure the game will suffer a bad start because of all the big dev. promises, but I hope it will eventually deliver at least partially on the promises, sort of like FFXIV ARR or ESO. <br/>To your situation, to be honest you just sound like a butthurt gf now.

All of them are either over-critic, over-negative, over-hyped, over-speculating, focusing to much on a specific audience, borin, or repeating the same info over and over  yall know who i mean xdddddd<br/> Next to this having official content creators does make smaller creators feel less motivated to hype the game up. After seeing stuff how by defauld they get earlyer lift of NDA, acces to QnA etc while smaller creators with potential wont get above 10 vieuws for a long time. I will personally not even make videos anymore besides one copy pasta pre alpha vid to let my small 500 subs from a old mmo know a new big game is coming.<br/><br/>One advice if intrepid is reading this = a &#39;creator&#39; who gets the shine QnA and additional info, should be picked by the community itselve! by you guys simply seeing who gets the most vieuws and reaches the most people once the game is released or further in developement.</td>

They aren&#39;t showing the MMO stuff quite yet because it&#39;s not ready to be presented, they&#39;ve presented all they have ready so far and that&#39;s why current phases of the testing for the MMO are still under NDA. WoW did the same, they just didn&#39;t need to fix their combat outside of internal testing because it was simple tab-targetting. That&#39;s why this BR is available and as a company it makes sense that if people are willing to buy a product like cosmetics for the game, why not let them? You&#39;re literally shitting on a company for wanting to make extra money by allowing a FREE version of the combat test to be playable by the masses. You&#39;re not a credible source of information at all, and I hope more people realize that and it really doesn&#39;t surprise me they kicked you from the program.</td>

<td>Watched the whole video. I honestly think agree with you on most all points you made. I did not fund this game because honestly I don&#39;t believe in giving my money away to people I don&#39;t know with the promise of something crazy new and exciting that would be an awesome MMO. Basically sounds too good to be true, especially from a kick starter company, I don&#39;t care who is in charge.  I did however have high hopes for the game because if they did do that, it would be pretty fucking cool.  I lost even more faith when I heard they made an actual BR out of the game....cause quite honestly I think BR is trash and so is Fortnight and this is just a damn cash grab.  Just as a side note as well, I hate completely negative reviews because it does sound like a viewers grab, but most everything here makes sense and I can understand the passionate frustration especially since I did watch all your previous vids on this game and they were all very positive for the game.  In the end I agree with your end statement.  I hope to god we are wrong and they release a finished game within a 1-1/2 years but as of right now, I doubt it.</td>

If you got kicked or not COULD maybe matter in the long run with how Steven will handle things in the future, we sure as well don&#39;t want another Escape from Tarkov situation on our hands, it would sink the game real quick.<br/><br/>As far as the game goes... I liked the idea of BR as a test, but now they are making it its own thing and pumped it full of microtransactions which is scary... sure feels like they are trying to milk people hardcore.<br/>They sure as heckle haven&#39;t shown anything NEW for the MMO in ages either, I also think the game will be pushed back a bit, 2021/22 if they want to add everything they promised before they release the game, though that is a super long time.. and &quot;push the game out, we&#39;ll fix it with patches&#39; is far to common now so who knows how it&#39;ll all work out in the end.<br/><br/>But I think the biggest and worst thing is communication, it sucks because there is none..........

<td>I made it to the end (21 minute shoutout). I was also part of Danny&#39;s stream during the filming of this podcast. I believe that you expressed your opinions as opinions, and while some of it had valid points behind it, you had trouble articulating the actual points behind them due to your passion / emotion in the feelings you had. That being said, at no point did you state anything that warranted a removal from the content creator program, and in fact, the only thing that could&#39;ve been done better is allowing a developer from Intrepid to respond to some of your concerns in a Q&amp;A session. Even if you were to be removed, being removed without a discussion beforehand or a notice at the time of action is weirdly unprofessional. I believe that a community post is warranted from the developers of Intrepid clearly outlining what they had issues with, especially if they don&#39;t have clear cut rules for their content creators for the program. You may not be the biggest content creator ever, but I find it highly worrisome that you are effectively being silenced by the game company because you expressed concerns while their very dismissal e-mail states you have the right to do so. <br/><br/>The only thing that I really wish for beyond this, of course, was that I had been able to comment during the podcast itself as I provided many points of feedback throughout the discussion that may have helped you express your point without resorting to an emotional standpoint, which I have to conclude is their issue given the coverage in the podcast. <br/><br/>Lastly, any game company that&#39;s spending this much of their early resource pool on art, animation, and monetization of a game mode is highly suspect in my opinion. Yes, games can often be decided by their visual aspect, but if you&#39;re resorting to crowdfunding and revenue generation this early on and your game appears this polished with no actual content available, that&#39;s a huge issue. Additionally, as the podcast mentioned many of the systems that you want to test may be related to the back end of the software - however, you can put in testing/dev switches --even if it&#39;s a simple text print to console when you trigger certain actions, proving that the trigger actually functions when it should and doesn&#39;t function when it shouldn&#39;t is an early proof of concept mechanism. <br/><br/>If Ashes of Creation requires a community manager that can actually manage expectations as you mentioned during the podcast (which I personally suspect is why you were removed - saying that Steven isn&#39;t the person to occupy this position), then I&#39;m open to hearing an inquiry. I think that a lot could be accomplished by coming to occupy a position like that, and not from the purpose of marketing but from organizing both expectations and tiers of tester - those that want to test features vs those that want to test concepts. There are different levels of time investment and interest available from different players, and right now it seems that there&#39;s no categorizing or tagging of these different groups. Additionally, having someone to handle issues like this - your removal from the program, removals and additions in general, and the community interpretation of these events would be ideal. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s on the hush-hush because nobody knows it happened unless they follow you, but it makes no sense that you&#39;re supposed to be contributing to their community growth but they don&#39;t even have an official page that mentions you. If they can&#39;t offer you any type of referral for views on your content, why would you contribute to their weird profit sharing business (percentage of future purchases in referrals? That basically is an MLM scheme -- which is highly worrying with the BR release) -- this just doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. <br/><br/>I would welcome your thoughts on this post, Ziz. I would also welcome discussion with the development team. Personally, I work in a hybrid role of development, support, and community management for my career with auditing software (a little different than a video game, I admit) and I couldn&#39;t imagine handling some things they way they are being handled. The problem with a project that&#39;s driven by a developer and not a client is scope creep - the list of features included is indeed a dreamer&#39;s list, and shipping a game with that many features would require a ridiculous level of investment. I&#39;ve been a silent observer on this game for some time now, mostly engaging in community discussions on Twitch, but I&#39;m starting to think maybe more active involvement is necessary given the recent trends I&#39;ve seen.</td>

Otherwise they could have done a king of the keep, ffa, team death match, or any other pvp gametype and it would have had more relevancy to the mmo. I feel used after the kickstarter since this wasn&#39;t mentioned and I feel that the BR and the legendary path is a cash grab. These better be obtainable through the castle siege and horde mode because I&#39;m not playing a BR. <br/><br/>I was buying things from the monthly exclusives but if they keep the legendary path I will no longer buy from them.</td>

<td>Using your analogy of the car. The BR is them using a different cheaper body of a car to show you how the internals work and for you to test the car before they can go into production of possibly their more expensive and time consuming car. which means once the internals are working how they want they just need to pass over those internals to the car you were promised aka action combat and environmental destruction and many other things we can&#39;t see server side.What part of this is not understood? Their latest stream was them showing how the BR works for the mmo from how easy they were able to transition even if just a piece from the BR to the MMO. They are letting us test mechanics to pass them on to the mmo. Some how you are mad at the fact that they are giving you another car to make sure the one you really paid for is perfect at the end of the day. I hear ya and understand as a Kickstarter backer myself but man keep in mind other companies wouldn&#39;t even show you half of what these guys do and would probably leave you in the dark for long periods of time.</td>

<td>I made it to the end of the video. I&#39;ll be honest here, I have mixed feelings about it. Here&#39;s a few points.<br/><br/>1. We can feel your frustration towards the game throughout the video. It comes across as negativity and hate, but I&#39;m sure anyone reasonable enough to understand the frustration will get past that.<br/><br/>2. You make a few good points based on facts. Mainly that we&#39;re not shown anything of substance yet.<br/><br/>3. You make a few insignificant points, and couldve made the video more impactful if you focused on you main point. What I think is, you tried to convey the point you wanted to make in the podcast in this video, along with defending yourself from steven&#39;s post, while also ranting and venting. (Whether this is true or not, I do not know. I am just speculating.)<br/><br/>4. Point 3 is pure speculation, and your video is about the same, speculation and worry. Maybe if you make that clear, you will come accross more as a worried fan rather than someone that is angry.<br/><br/>5. I think Steven took the decision to kick you out because they&#39;re not sure what your goal is. If your goal is clearly on the positive side (the worried fan that still has faith), then it has to be clear. Otherwise they don&#39;t have any incentive on keeping you in the program. As a company, they&#39;re worried about their image which I&#39;m sure anyone can understand. <br/><br/>Anyway, now I&#39;m also worried. I have high expectations for this game, but you made me realise that... it&#39;s not as crisp as I thought it would be. There&#39;s still a long way to go until release, hopefully they do some nice work :) I have no clue how fast a game should be developping so.. I&#39;m still excited.<br/><br/>Cheers</td>

<td>Almost all my informations about the game come from you so its sad to hear that you are having bad experience with the game developers.<br/>Luckely I never spend any money for kickstarter things because I generally think its not fair at all. Game developers should always have to take the financial risk for their game in my oppinion. Everything else doesnt make sense to me. Kickstarter shifts this risk to the consumer (In your case 400!$ and if the game sucks you have lost this money) and the earnings are still going to the developers while they will lose nothing if they make a bad game. They will have jobs for years and they can do almost nothing during that time if they decide so.<br/>So lucky me I dont accept to take the risk that someone else is supposed to take.<br/>Despite hearing your concerns I still hope this game will get great and super fun because I m really searching for a good game for months now.<br/>So lets hope the best right?</td>

I knew it was just gonna turn into a shit show. <br/>They took peoples money on a promise of an mmo. Then now they make a BR instead? Get out of here. Thats scummy as fuck</td>

<td>As someone who has been following this game since before the kickstarter, I must agree with Ziz here. The footage of the MMO they are showing now doesn&#39;t seem to show any kind of real improvement from the stuff we were seeing a year and a half ago... All they can show us is them running around in the world (which I must admit looks nice). As said in the video, we haven&#39;t seen ANY of the actual systems that got us all hyped of for the game, wether it be caravans, crafting, housing, naval content, raids or nodes (we have seen a tiny bit of the nodes in action but nothing impressive). <br/><br/>It&#39;s just frustrating especially considering how much time and energy they are wasting on this battle royale thing, which anyone with half a brain knows is just a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the success of Fortnite. <br/><br/>And don&#39;t hit me with that &quot;it&#39;s still early development&quot;. I know MMO&#39;s take time to make, but it&#39;s been TWO YEARS since the game was announced, and according to their own words on a video they did with TheLazyPeon, the game had already been in development for some time when it was announced. If they still can&#39;t show us anything with any kind of substance, even if it is buggy and unfinished, after TWO YEARS+ they obviously have some problems. <br/><br/>I&#39;m sounding like some pathetic hater, but it&#39;s just incredibly sad as someone who put money into it when the kickstarter was around and was really excited to see where this project would be going :(</td>

<td>Lol what part of alpha did you forget, they are opening up this to the public to save money on paying people to test the game.  You don&#39;t have to pay into anything, no one is forcing you to participate in the testing. You want views and now your bitter, tough way to make a living.  How long is the average mmorpg in development for.  Stop being a child.</td>

<td>I can&#39;t help but feel incredibly frustrated on the behalf of Intrepid. They open themselves up to let us watch while they work so they can get valid feedback right... Well development is never smooth sailing and never easy. It&#39;s stressful and you&#39;ll often have 2 steps forward and 10 steps back. So what&#39;s perfectly normal to the devs is now seen as the sky is falling to people like you - parasites who just feed off scraps of news from them the actual content creators. <br/><br/>You&#39;re gonna get mad at the shark when it starts shaking you off for trying to kill it prematurely? Sure everyone&#39;s welcome to speculate but if you&#39;re gonna be seen as a valid source of information on behalf of Intrepid, leave your speculations at the fucking door. You&#39;re just giving ammunition to their competition and people who want to see them fail over something that I GUARANTEE, in 4 months time won&#39;t even matter. All this false outrage and drama will be forgotten once the MMO game enters Alpha 1 but that won&#39;t matter to you right? You&#39;ll have gotten a nice stack of views off this video and an army rallied at Intrepids door to make their morale tank even harder over their crunch filled holidays.<br/><br/>I hope you archive videos like this though, just so we can all look back and see what an absolute twat people like you were being during all this.</td>

<td>Woah, worrying.. I hope for the best, maybe there is some key-tech that they struggling on, and once sorted it&#39;s good progress from there. But since they&#39;re not transparent or outright lying, they have themselves to blame. Hopefully they are actually working on the MMO, I&#39;m patient, I&#39;m a Star Citizen backer so I guess I can wait for this as well.. :-|</td>

<td>Steven is, regrettable, becoming quite fond of silencing the strong dissent coming about in response to his decision to MASSIVELY deviate from all industry norms, player expectations and frankly just common sense to create a stand alone game in an entirely different genre.<br/><br/>I will be blunt. I hate BR games, and it really ticks me off to see the money(over a thousand dollars counting cosmetics) I spent on AN MMORPG being WASTED on this thing. Whatever they may glean from it in testing is all well and good, but they could have done that just as easily with an upgraded Alpha 0 experience.<br/><br/>No, this was all about the almighty dollar and leveraging the popularity of Fortnite and pubg style battle royale games. Steven finds Ziz &quot;disappointing?&quot; He can call me back when he&#39;s as DEVASTATED as I was to watch this debacle unfold with a project I really cared about a great deal. it&#39;s just so sad.<br/><br/>_<br/><br/>Just got to the part about reddit. I indeed got BANNED from that reddit for nonsense that happened on the DISCORD and possibly twitter as part of a global &quot;community&quot; ban that covered everything Intrepid controls except their twitch at the moment, and that probably won&#39;t last.<br/><br/>And as far as secret channels? YES. I ran it better discord before they made it enforceable against discord&#39;s rules. They exist alright. <br/><br/>Marketing manager? Sure, that concerns me as well. We need a COMMUNITY manager full time. Marketing should be entirely separate.</td>
